python-trace-decorator
----------------------

Python function-tracing module based on the recipe by Kevin L. Sitze

http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577551-trace-decorator-for-debugging/

but modified to work with python 3 (should work with 3.3 or greater). 
Still compatible with python 2.7, but not with older python versions.
